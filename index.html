            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p> Hi, my name is Jason. I have been tutoring for over 10 years. I get excited when students see how their academic studies have real world implications.
                Schoolwork can often feel abstract and overwhelming. I will help transform your coursework into concrete and manageable concepts. In so doing, I will help propel you toward your life goals.

            <p> I have experience tutoring students across a wide range of subjects and life stages, with particular expertise in computer science, computer programming, physics, and math.

            <p> I provide a highly customized curriculum to meet your unique needs. The first step in tailoring your tutoring experience to your personal needs is our initial phone call.
                During that call we will discern if I will be a good fit for your particular needs and we will discuss a variety of topics, including: Your current and previous experiences
                with the subject for which you are seeking assistance; your learning style and patterns; your academic areas of strength and weakness; and your personal academic goals.
                Additionally, in order to maximize the benefits of your tutoring experience, it may be beneficial to provide me with a copy of your class syllabus, textbook, and/or homework assignments.
                In so doing, I will be able to focus our work on the specific features of your coursework.

            <p> I graduated with a Ph.D. in Physics from UCSD in 2016. I received a Springer Thesis award for my graduate dissertation, a Chateaubriand Fellowship and ARCS Scholarship.
                I graduated with distinction from Harvey Mudd College with a B.S. in Physics. Harvey Mudd College is a member of the Claremont Colleges Consortium and is a STEM focused liberal arts college.
                In high school, I earned a 5 on AP exams in Physics B, Calculus BC, Computer Science AB and Chemistry.

            <p> At UCSD I tutored both undergraduate and graduate students. I worked in the physics tutorial center and prepared students for the physics departmental exam.
